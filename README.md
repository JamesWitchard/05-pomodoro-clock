#Calculator 
This is a [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) final project. It's a count down timer which allows you to set
intervals of study and breaks, it will then count down the session length, playing an alarm when it reaches 0, and then 
begins counting down the break time.

##Tools
This is a React.js based application.

##Challenges
Largest challenge was working with the way React updates the DOM and also handling a setInterval function call. [Found an 
excellent video on the subject on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWKz9aLovjY) which helped immensely. Run into
some issues with the FCC test suite, but I eventually solved it with some brute force.
